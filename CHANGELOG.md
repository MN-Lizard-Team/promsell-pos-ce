## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed — RenderFlex overflow hotfix + system-wide bug fixes

Layout hotfix for three `RenderFlex` overflows in the sale page, combined with a targeted sweep on data integrity, stale cart state, and cashier UX.

### Highlights

- **Layout correctness:** Removed a phantom `Text` after `Expanded` that received 0dp and caused a 3px overflow on every launch.
- **Thai-locale resilience:** Increased card `mainAxisExtent` and zeroed implicit `Card` margin to fit Noto Sans Thai diacritic metrics.
- **DB safety:** `onUpgrade` now throws `UnimplementedError` — schema bumps without a migration fail loudly instead of silently wiping data.
- **Cart integrity:** Cart snapshots sync live from `ProductBloc`; hard-deleted products are removed automatically before checkout.
- **Checkout integrity:** Deleted product at confirm time throws a clear `StateError`; DB reads per item halved (2N → N).

### Fixed

#### Sale page

- Removed `BlocBuilder<SaleBloc>` returning `Text` after `Expanded` in `_SaleCatalog` — 0dp allocation caused a 3px bottom overflow.
- Replaced `Expanded(Text(name))` with `Text(name)` + `Spacer()` in `_ProductCard` to prevent 3–9px overflow from font-metric rounding at high DPI.
- Increased `mainAxisExtent` (`122→136` narrow, `132→148` wide) for Noto Sans Thai stacked-diacritic height.
- Added `margin: EdgeInsets.zero` to `_ProductCard`'s `Card` — default `EdgeInsets.all(4)` silently consumed 8dp per grid slot.

#### `AppEmptyState`

- Added `veryCompact` tier (< 120dp): icon `32→24dp`, padding `12→8dp`, style `titleMedium→bodyMedium`, `maxLines: 1`.

#### Database

- `onUpgrade` now throws `UnimplementedError` instead of a silent no-op, preventing data loss on future schema version bumps.

#### Cart state

- Added `SaleCartProductsRefreshed` event: `BlocListener<ProductBloc>` in `_SaleView` syncs cart item snapshots on every product update and auto-removes hard-deleted items.

#### Sale checkout

- Null product now throws `StateError("… no longer exists")` instead of silently bypassing stock validation.
- Products fetched once into a map and reused across validation and deduction loops — eliminates duplicate DB reads per item.

#### Payment sheet

- `_quickAmounts()` always generates three distinct chips; round totals (e.g. ฿100) no longer collapse to a single "Exact" chip.

### Added

- Regression test: `AppEmptyState fits in very compact height` (96dp bounded height, verifies no overflow).

### Changed

- Removed dead `onChanged: SaleNoteChanged(value)` from the payment sheet note field — note is read from the controller directly at confirm time.
- Cleaned up 5 lint warnings in test files: `no_leading_underscores_for_local_identifiers`, `prefer_const_constructors`, `prefer_const_literals_to_create_immutables`.
- Updated documentation (`README.md`, `CODEBASE.md`) and bumped version to `0.2.3+1`.

### Verification

- `flutter test` passed: **131/131 tests**.
- `flutter analyze` completed with **0 issues**.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed — Stability, data integrity, and UX hardening

A stability and UX hardening release for the offline POS workflow: safer sales writes, clearer cashier feedback, tighter BLoC behavior, leaner dependencies, and better compact-screen usability.

### Highlights

- **Data safety:** Stock is validated before sale-item insertion, while checkout still remains transaction-protected.
- **Cashier UX:** Cart quantity limits, product quantity badges, cleaner add-to-cart feedback, payment references, and double-submit protection.
- **State reliability:** Product, sale, history, and settings flows now recover and refresh more predictably.
- **UI consistency:** Theme-aware danger colors, safer dialog contexts, clearer empty states, retry actions, and responsive settings controls.
- **Maintenance:** Removed unused dependencies and dead DI registrations; documented intentional singleton usage.

### Fixed

#### Sale and checkout

- Prevented partial sale-item work by validating all item stock before insert/deduct operations.
- Added stock-limit protection to cart quantity controls and kept database validation as the final authority.
- Prevented duplicate payment submissions from rapid double taps.
- Added optional transfer/card payment reference support, stored through the sale note.
- Made payment sheet dismissal safe when the sheet context is already unmounted.
- Reset sale state correctly after a completed sale when starting a new cart.

#### Products and inventory

- Reworked `ProductBloc` stream handling to avoid blocking refresh flows.
- Added reliable product save status handling so forms close only after confirmed saves.
- Reset stale product save status on product stream updates.
- Added product-card cart quantity badges in the sale catalog.
- Reduced noisy add-to-cart SnackBars for repeated taps.
- Made product delete dialogs use a captured BLoC and dialog-local navigation context.
- Improved stock-zero warning and product form feedback.

#### History and reports

- Limited initial history loading to a default 30-day range.
- Made history date picker reopen with the current selected range.
- Replaced fake refresh delays with state-based refresh completion.
- Fixed report date ranges that could go stale overnight.
- Moved report date range display out of the AppBar into a compact filter chip.
- Added pull-to-refresh support to the report dashboard.

#### Settings and localization

- Settings load failures now fall back to usable default settings instead of leaving the app in a failure state.
- Removed duplicate settings save notifications for live locale/theme changes.
- Added dirty-state awareness for manually saved text settings.
- Improved responsive settings dropdown layout on compact screens.
- Added EN/TH strings for retry actions, no-match states, stock limits, and payment references.

#### UI, accessibility, and resilience

- Replaced hardcoded destructive colors with `colorScheme.error`.
- Added retry actions to shared empty/error states.
- Improved dialog context safety for cart clearing and product deletion.
- Clarified intentional `SaleItems.productId` behavior so sale history survives product deletion.
- Documented the intentional singleton lifecycle for `ProductBloc`.

### Removed

- Removed unused direct dependencies: `go_router`, `uuid`, `permission_handler`, `image_picker`, `cached_network_image`, `qr_flutter`, and `path`.
- Removed unused DI registrations for `GetReport` and `GetSaleHistory` while keeping their source/test coverage for future use.
- Deleted the empty `date_formatter.dart` file.

### Changed

- Updated generated localization files after adding new EN/TH keys.
- Updated SettingsCubit tests to match the load-failure fallback behavior.
- Updated documentation and audit notes for the completed stability and UX hardening work.
- Bumped version to `0.2.2+1`.

### Verification

- `flutter gen-l10n` completed successfully.
- `flutter test` passed: **130/130 tests**.
- `flutter analyze` completed with **0 errors** and only pre-existing info-level hints in tests.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-26

### Added — Comprehensive test suite & UI/UX improvements

- **130 automated tests** covering 7 layers of the application:
  - **Domain** — entity equality, use case delegation for all features
  - **BLoC / Cubit** — event-to-state transitions for `SaleBloc`, `ProductBloc`, `HistoryBloc`, `SettingsCubit`
  - **Repository** — `SaleRepositoryImpl`, `ProductRepositoryImpl`, `HistoryRepositoryImpl`, `SettingsRepositoryImpl`
  - **Datasource** — `ProductLocalDatasourceImpl`, `SaleLocalDatasourceImpl` with in-memory SQLite
  - **Widget** — `ProductListPage`, `ProductFormPage`, `PaymentSheet`, `SettingsPage` with mocked BLoC states
  - **Integration** — end-to-end checkout flow (add → sale → stock deduction → history)
  - **L10n parity** — EN/TH key completeness, parameterized messages, locale-specific values
- **Test helpers** (`test/helpers/`):
  - `mocks.dart` — shared mock classes using `mocktail` + `bloc_test`
  - `pump_app.dart` — `pumpApp` extension with `MultiBlocProvider` and full localization
  - `fake_database.dart` — in-memory Drift database factory
- **4 new localization keys** for both EN and TH:
  - `productAddedToCart` — cart feedback message
  - `productSaved` — form success message
  - `insufficientCash` — payment validation hint
  - `stockZeroWarning` — product form warning
- **4 regression tests** for critical UI bug fixes (UI-BUG-1, UI-BUG-8, UI-BUG-11)

### Fixed

- **Search state bleed across tabs** — `ProductBloc.searchQuery` resets on navigation; `BlocListener` syncs text controllers automatically
- **Cart quantity overflow** — replaced fixed `SizedBox(width: 28)` with `ConstrainedBox(minWidth: 32)` to support 3+ digit quantities
- **Cart subtotal clipping** — replaced fixed `SizedBox(width: 82)` with `ConstrainedBox(minWidth: 82)` for large amounts
- **No feedback on add-to-cart** — floating `SnackBar` now confirms product addition
- **No feedback on product save** — success `SnackBar` shown after form submission
- **Report AppBar overflow** — date range text wrapped in `Flexible` with `TextOverflow.ellipsis`
- **Redundant tap hint** — "Tap product to add" hidden when cart already has items
- **Unclear disabled button** — payment confirm shows "Insufficient cash" explanation when amount is below total
- **Missing transaction reference** — sale ID (`#N`) now displayed in History list subtitle
- **No refresh mechanism** — pull-to-refresh added to History and Product list pages
- **Silent stock=0 state** — product form shows warning when stock is zero ("won't appear in sale")

### Changed

- Added `sqlite3_flutter_libs: ^0.5.28` to `dev_dependencies` for FFI-based in-memory database testing.
