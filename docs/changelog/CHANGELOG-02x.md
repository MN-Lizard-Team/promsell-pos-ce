## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-26

Layout hotfix for RenderFlex overflows in the sale page, plus data integrity, cart state, and cashier UX improvements.

### Fixed

#### Sale page

- Fixed RenderFlex overflows in product catalog and product card layouts.
- Improved product card sizing for Thai font rendering.

#### Database

- `onUpgrade` now throws `UnimplementedError` — schema bumps without a migration fail loudly instead of silently.

#### Cart state

- Cart syncs live with product state; hard-deleted products are auto-removed before checkout.

#### Sale checkout

- Selling a deleted product now throws a clear error instead of silently bypassing validation.
- Reduced duplicate database reads during checkout.

#### Payment sheet

- Quick-amount chips always generate three distinct values; round totals no longer collapse to a single "Exact" chip.

### Added

- Regression test for `AppEmptyState` compact layout.

### Changed

- Removed dead `onChanged` handler from payment sheet note field.
- Cleaned up 5 lint warnings in test files.
- Updated documentation (`README.md`, `CODEBASE.md`).

`flutter analyze` → **0 issues** · `flutter test` → **131/131 passing**

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-26

Stability and UX hardening for the offline POS workflow: safer sales writes, clearer cashier feedback, tighter BLoC behavior, leaner dependencies, and better compact-screen usability.

### Fixed

#### Sale and checkout

- Prevented partial sale-item work by validating all item stock before insert/deduct operations.
- Added stock-limit protection to cart quantity controls and kept database validation as the final authority.
- Prevented duplicate payment submissions from rapid double taps.
- Added optional transfer/card payment reference support, stored through the sale note.
- Made payment sheet dismissal safe when the sheet context is already unmounted.
- Reset sale state correctly after a completed sale when starting a new cart.

#### Products and inventory

- Reworked `ProductBloc` stream handling to avoid blocking refresh flows.
- Added reliable product save status handling so forms close only after confirmed saves.
- Reset stale product save status on product stream updates.
- Added product-card cart quantity badges in the sale catalog.
- Reduced noisy add-to-cart SnackBars for repeated taps.
- Made product delete dialogs use a captured BLoC and dialog-local navigation context.
- Improved stock-zero warning and product form feedback.

#### History and reports

- Limited initial history loading to a default 30-day range.
- Made history date picker reopen with the current selected range.
- Replaced fake refresh delays with state-based refresh completion.
- Fixed report date ranges that could go stale overnight.
- Moved report date range display out of the AppBar into a compact filter chip.
- Added pull-to-refresh support to the report dashboard.

#### Settings and localization

- Settings load failures now fall back to usable default settings instead of leaving the app in a failure state.
- Removed duplicate settings save notifications for live locale/theme changes.
- Added dirty-state awareness for manually saved text settings.
- Improved responsive settings dropdown layout on compact screens.
- Added EN/TH strings for retry actions, no-match states, stock limits, and payment references.

#### UI, accessibility, and resilience

- Replaced hardcoded destructive colors with `colorScheme.error`.
- Added retry actions to shared empty/error states.
- Improved dialog context safety for cart clearing and product deletion.
- Clarified intentional `SaleItems.productId` behavior so sale history survives product deletion.
- Documented the intentional singleton lifecycle for `ProductBloc`.

### Removed

- Removed unused direct dependencies: `go_router`, `uuid`, `permission_handler`, `image_picker`, `cached_network_image`, `qr_flutter`, and `path`.
- Removed unused DI registrations for `GetReport` and `GetSaleHistory` while keeping their source/test coverage for future use.
- Deleted the empty `date_formatter.dart` file.

### Changed

- Updated generated localization files after adding new EN/TH keys.
- Updated SettingsCubit tests to match the load-failure fallback behavior.
- Updated documentation and audit notes for the completed stability and UX hardening work.
- Bumped version to `0.2.2+1`.

`flutter analyze` → **0 issues** · `flutter test` → **130/130 passing**

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- **130 automated tests** covering 7 layers of the application:
  - **Domain** — entity equality, use case delegation for all features
  - **BLoC / Cubit** — event-to-state transitions for `SaleBloc`, `ProductBloc`, `HistoryBloc`, `SettingsCubit`
  - **Repository** — `SaleRepositoryImpl`, `ProductRepositoryImpl`, `HistoryRepositoryImpl`, `SettingsRepositoryImpl`
  - **Datasource** — `ProductLocalDatasourceImpl`, `SaleLocalDatasourceImpl` with in-memory SQLite
  - **Widget** — `ProductListPage`, `ProductFormPage`, `PaymentSheet`, `SettingsPage` with mocked BLoC states
  - **Integration** — end-to-end checkout flow (add → sale → stock deduction → history)
  - **L10n parity** — EN/TH key completeness, parameterized messages, locale-specific values
- **Test helpers** (`test/helpers/`):
  - `mocks.dart` — shared mock classes using `mocktail` + `bloc_test`
  - `pump_app.dart` — `pumpApp` extension with `MultiBlocProvider` and full localization
  - `fake_database.dart` — in-memory Drift database factory
- **4 new localization keys** for both EN and TH:
  - `productAddedToCart` — cart feedback message
  - `productSaved` — form success message
  - `insufficientCash` — payment validation hint
  - `stockZeroWarning` — product form warning
- **4 regression tests** for critical UI bug fixes (UI-BUG-1, UI-BUG-8, UI-BUG-11)

### Fixed

- **Search state bleed across tabs** — `ProductBloc.searchQuery` resets on navigation; `BlocListener` syncs text controllers automatically
- **Cart quantity overflow** — replaced fixed `SizedBox(width: 28)` with `ConstrainedBox(minWidth: 32)` to support 3+ digit quantities
- **Cart subtotal clipping** — replaced fixed `SizedBox(width: 82)` with `ConstrainedBox(minWidth: 82)` for large amounts
- **No feedback on add-to-cart** — floating `SnackBar` now confirms product addition
- **No feedback on product save** — success `SnackBar` shown after form submission
- **Report AppBar overflow** — date range text wrapped in `Flexible` with `TextOverflow.ellipsis`
- **Redundant tap hint** — "Tap product to add" hidden when cart already has items
- **Unclear disabled button** — payment confirm shows "Insufficient cash" explanation when amount is below total
- **Missing transaction reference** — sale ID (`#N`) now displayed in History list subtitle
- **No refresh mechanism** — pull-to-refresh added to History and Product list pages
- **Silent stock=0 state** — product form shows warning when stock is zero ("won't appear in sale")

### Changed

- Added `sqlite3_flutter_libs: ^0.5.28` to `dev_dependencies` for FFI-based in-memory database testing.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- **Shared UI primitives** under `lib/core/widgets/`:
  - `AdaptiveBreakpoints` for compact/medium/expanded layout decisions
  - `AppEmptyState` for consistent empty/error states with compact-height handling
  - `MoneyText` for consistent currency display
  - `SectionCard` for grouped settings and dashboard surfaces
- **Sale tab redesign** via `sale_page.dart`:
  - Search-first product catalog
  - Category chips

  - Touch-friendly quantity controls and checkout action
- **Payment sheet redesign** via `payment_sheet_redesign.dart`:

  - Responsive product form with compact single-column and wider two-column layouts
- **History, Report, and Settings refresh**:
  - Receipt-like expandable history cards
  - Report dashboard with empty/error states
  - Settings grouped into section cards with a clearer save action
- **Widget tests** for shared UI components.

### Fixed

- Prevented compact empty-state layouts from causing `RenderFlex` bottom overflow in constrained panels.

### Changed

- Updated localization strings for sale search, cart title, category filter, and quick cash actions.
- Updated theme tokens and Material 3 component defaults for the refreshed visual system.
